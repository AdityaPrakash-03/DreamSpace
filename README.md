Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend server and the frontend mobile app.

1. Backend Setup (Python)
First, get the server running.

# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd dreamspace_backend

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the Flask server
python app.py

Note: If requirements.txt does not exist, run pip install Flask Pillow. The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

2. Frontend Setup (Flutter)
Next, set up the Flutter application.

# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd dreamspace_ai

# 2. Get all the Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. IMPORTANT: Configure the Backend IP Address
#    Open lib/providers/app_provider.dart and update the _backendUrl variable
#    with your computer's local IP address.

# 4. Run the app on an emulator or a connected device
flutter run
